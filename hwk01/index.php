            <p>A Saturday Night is a VR experience where the user could dance to the music and if they had the proper equipment, record the dance moves done. Just based on this description, I found this really unique, since the site can save how the user danced and allows them to share their dance moves to the public or friends. It's a fun and clean looking experience. The user is placed in an environment on top of a dance floor with a bear. I assume this bear dancing is an example of a user's recorded dance as I don't have any equipment to use to experience this fully.</p>

            <p>Rome's Invisible City is a VR experience that tour's the user of Rome; telling its history and putting them into the environment. I enjoyed this experience for its ambience and narration while viewing the scenery as if I were there brought it all together. The transition between scenes is subtle and the user wasn't left in silence or the dark for an extended length of time. The size of the image is scaled to as if the user were actually standing at the location. I also enjoyed the narration voice telling the user about the location and the history of the place.</p>

            <h2>Konterball</h2>

            <img src="../img/konterball-vr.png" alt="A-Saturday-Night Screen Shot">

            <p>Konterball is a VR experience where the user, or multiple users, can play a  game of ping pong. While it doesn't use the full 360 as you need to face the table to participate in the game, the graphics and SFX of the game is smooth and polished. I enjoy the simplicity, the clean transitions, and the controls even on the desktop version. Every graphic on screen is necessary and there are no overly distracting graphics while I was playing the game.</p>
